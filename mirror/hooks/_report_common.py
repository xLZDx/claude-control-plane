"""Shared counting logic for the report hooks.

`report_due.py` (Stop) and `report_gate.py` (PreToolUse on `git commit`/`git push`) must agree on
what "unreported work" means, or a session gets blocked by one and cleared by the other. The
definition lives here once.

Thresholds were set from measured behaviour on 2026-08-19 across six repositories in D:\\Repo --
longest run of consecutive commits with no commit touching reports/: ERP 10, formcoach 5,
Virtual_marketing_company 4, Fitness_App 4, AI_trading_assistance 3, Ferma 1. Three is where
ordinary work stops and a silent gate starts; a lone commit never trips anything, because that is
the small-fix case.

`unanswered_handover()` (added 2026-08-19, same day) covers a different gap: the skill says to
STOP after handing a report over, but nothing enforced that. A Fitness_App session handed over a
stop-the-line report -- dream-team review found the tested APK wasn't even built from the branch
under test, MVP gate not closed -- got no operator reply (only an automatic context-compaction
boundary), and kept going: wrote a second report, committed it, and pushed. The operator caught
this from a VS Code "open external website" popup on the first report's link and asked why the
session hadn't simply stopped. It reads the session's own transcript for the most recent complete
handover (a real, non-placeholder `reports/...ru.html` path plus an artifact URL in the same
assistant message) and whether a genuine operator message -- not a compaction boundary, not a
sidechain/subagent message -- has arrived since. No reply since the last handover means the next
`git commit` or `git push` is denied outright, independent of anything it carries.

`program_mode_declared()` (added 2026-08-19, same day, third revision) is the fix for a design
tension the two rules above created together: "write a report per closed gate" plus "stop after
every report" adds up to "stop after every sub-gate" -- exactly wrong for a long run the operator
has already pre-authorized end to end and does not want to babysit. The operator's own words:
"нужно дождаться окончания прогона а потом писать финальный репорт и не останавливаться после
каждого сабгейта" -- wait for the run to finish, then write the final report, don't stop after
every sub-gate. The fix is not an env-var opt-out (that was proposed and explicitly rejected here:
env vars must be set before a session starts, so they cannot cover "the operator says so mid-run"),
it is a marker phrase in a GENUINE operator message -- the same trust boundary `unanswered_handover`
already uses to unblock a handover, extended to also suspend both report-cadence checks for the
rest of the transcript. A model cannot forge a genuine `user`-typed transcript row, so this cannot
be self-authorized any more than the existing "operator replied" unblock can.

Bug found and fixed 2026-08-21: `program_mode_declared()` used the shared `_tail_rows()` helper
with its default bounded read (`TRANSCRIPT_TAIL_BYTES`, 3 MB) -- fine for `unanswered_handover()`,
which genuinely only cares about recent history, wrong here, where the docstring's own promise is
"anywhere in the transcript". A program-mode declaration is typically said once near the start of a
long run; once that session's transcript grows past 3 MB (routine for a multi-gate program), the
declaring message falls out of the tail window and the check silently starts returning False again
`pm_mode_active()` / `program_mode_active()` (added 2026-08-26) give program mode a second, standing
trigger: PM Bridge orchestrator mode being ON. `program_mode_declared` only fires in the session the
operator typed the marker phrase into, so every OTHER project kept stopping at its report handover
during a pre-authorized run. Operator: "надо убедиться что такое не будет повторяться ни на одном
проекте если включен пм режим, сессия может закончиться только тогда когда задача полностью
выполнена." See the block above those functions for why liveness is probed rather than trusted.

-- reported live as "program mode does not survive context compaction" from an ERP-style session,
though the actual mechanism is the byte-bounded file read, not the model's own context compaction
(the two often coincide because both are driven by transcript size, which is why it read as one
problem). Fixed by scanning the full file via `_tail_rows(path, full=True)` the first time, then
caching the result in a one-line per-session marker file (`_program_mode_marker_path`) so every
later call in the same session is an O(1) file-existence check instead of a repeated full scan.
