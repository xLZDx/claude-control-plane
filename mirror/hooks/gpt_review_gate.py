"""PreToolUse hook -- two independent checks, both via Bash/PowerShell. Operator GO,
2026-08-21 (Gate 5 of pm-bridge, see D:\\Repo\\pm-bridge\\core\\DECISION_LOG.md), forked
from codex_review_gate.py with the operator's explicit instruction to REPLACE the
(currently suspended) Codex mandatory-review gate with this one, same granularity and
same mechanics, only the reviewer and transport differ:

  1. `git commit` is blocked unless src/cli/review.js (in D:\\Repo\\pm-bridge) has been
     invoked (ANY receipt, any round/final status) for this repo recently -- proves a
     GPT review was at least ATTEMPTED for this gate.
  2. `git push` is blocked unless the MOST RECENT receipt for this repo has final=True --
     proves the gate's GPT consensus loop actually CONCLUDED, not just attempted once.
     See ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md "GPT Consensus Review (via PM Bridge)" -> "No push before
     the final round".

Why this exists: same failure mode codex_review_gate.py and decision_log_gate.py were
both built to close -- a text-only MANDATORY rule to send every gate's diff to GPT before
committing gets silently skipped without a mechanical gate. See codex_review_gate.py's own
header for the fuller history of that failure shape; this hook is a structural fork, not a
new design.

What the commit check verifies is ATTEMPT, not SUCCESS. review.js writes a receipt line to
RECEIPTS_FILE on every run, including its own fail-open error paths (login expired,
ChatGPT markup changed, conversation not found, timeout). A receipt with ok=false still
satisfies the commit gate -- the reviewer being unavailable must never block the operator's
actual work, only an unattempted review does.

What the push check verifies is CONCLUSION: the LATEST receipt for the repo must carry
final=True (set via review.js's --final flag on the last round of that gate's loop).

No quota-style short-TTL receipt class exists here (unlike codex_review_gate.py's
usage_limit_exhausted handling) -- ChatGPT's web UI has no equivalent machine-readable
quota signal to detect. This is a known, honestly-documented open gap (same posture as
the Codex quota gap already accepted in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md), not solved in this version.

No trivial-commit carve-out, deliberately, mirroring decision_log_gate.py and
codex_review_gate.py -- a gameable skip mechanism would defeat the point.

Scope, honestly (identical caveats to codex_review_gate.py):
- Catches git commit/push invoked through Claude Code's Bash/PowerShell tools only.
- A compound command containing both `git commit` and `git push` is held to the STRICTER
  push requirement (final receipt) for the whole command.
- Fails open on any internal error -- logged, never silent, never crashes the session.

Kill switch: CLAUDE_GPT_REVIEW_GATE=off -- SESSION/PROCESS-level env var, same rule as
CLAUDE_CODEX_REVIEW_GATE=off: must be set before this Claude Code process starts; inline
in the gated command has no effect. Covers both checks.

SCOPED TO pm-bridge ONLY as of 2026-08-21 (operator instruction, same day this gate was
built): the transport is still maturing -- new-conversation-per-send routing gaps, a live
"too many requests" incident, and a self-triggering detector bug were all found and fixed
during Gate 6's own build. The operator asked to keep the mandatory gate exercising itself
on pm-bridge (so it keeps getting hardened) while NOT blocking every other repo on this
machine on a mechanism still being debugged. See ENABLED_REPO_ROOTS below -- a repo whose
root is not under one of those paths skips BOTH checks entirely (allow, logged as
"allow-scoped-off"), same as if the whole gate were off for that repo. Widen or remove this
allowlist once the operator judges the mechanism reliable enough for other projects; ~/.claude/
CLAUDE.md section 15 carries the dated note.

# Temporary scope-down, operator instruction 2026-08-21 (see module docstring). Originally
# pm-bridge-only (every other repo unblocked, pm-bridge itself still gated so the mechanism
# kept exercising and hardening itself). Widened the SAME day to empty: pm-bridge's own
# push kept blocking on a real, unresolved detection bug in review.js's reply-wait logic
# (a fresh navigation repeatedly reported a stale turn count that didn't reflect a
# confirmed-real GPT reply -- see D:\Repo\pm-bridge\core\DECISION_LOG.md, "Gate 6
# aftermath, continued" and "... push-GO despite the unresolved bug"), and the operator
# explicitly asked to lift the gate for pm-bridge too rather than keep chasing more live
# rounds against that bug. Empty list = every repo allows through unconditionally, i.e.
# this whole hook is currently a no-op everywhere. Repopulate (with pm-bridge, or any
# repo) once the mechanism is trusted enough to re-cover it.
#
# Re-enabled for Fitness_App, 2026-08-22 (operator instruction, mid-P1.G4-gate session):
# the same underlying pm-bridge/playwright transport had just proven itself reliable in
# this exact session -- pm_set_gate's auto-notification to GPT-PM for P1.G4's close went
# through cleanly and got a real, on-topic reply. Scoped to Fitness_App only, not widened
# to every repo on the machine -- same conservative, one-repo-at-a-time posture as the
# original pm-bridge-only scoping.
#
# Widened to EVERY repo under D:\Repo, 2026-08-22, same day, later (direct operator
# instruction: "Мандаторный GPT-review гейт (§15) сейчас глобально включи"). `D:\Repo`
# itself as the sole root means `is_under()` matches any repo underneath it, not just
# Fitness_App/pm-bridge. Honest caveat, not resolved by this change: the specific
# unresolved bug that caused the SAME-day empty-list widening (review.js's reply-wait
# logic intermittently reporting a stale turn count after a fresh navigation -- see
# D:\Repo\pm-bridge\core\DECISION_LOG.md, "Gate 6 aftermath, continued") has not been
# independently re-verified fixed. A separate, different bug (duplicate ChatGPT tabs from
# an in-process race in Gate 8's session fast path) was fixed the same day
# (D:\Repo\pm-bridge commit 56f4317) -- that is NOT the same defect as the stale-turn-count
# one; do not treat one fix as evidence the other is resolved. This is a fail-open gate
# (an unattempted/failed review never blocks a commit, only an absent one does; push still
# requires final=True), so the practical risk of widening now is degraded review coverage
# on other repos' pushes, not a hard block -- but it means "mandatory GPT review" may in
# practice mean "attempted, possibly against a stale reply" more often outside Fitness_App/
# pm-bridge until that bug is separately confirmed fixed.

# Fitness_App push-gate excluded, 2026-08-26 (operator instruction, live recurrence of the exact
# bug documented above): commit 1decbc5e17690b0f3269d51fba2d32d9c9aad21a was reviewed to genuine
# consensus -- GPT-PM said VERDICT: APPROVE / PUSH: AUTHORIZED for this exact SHA four times in a
# row (once in chat, three times via review.js --final, rounds 9-11), with specific, accurate,
# mutually consistent content each time -- but all three review.js rounds came back
# correlated:false, so --final was mechanically withheld and push stayed blocked despite genuine
# operator authorization (chosen explicitly over retrying again, after 3 straight failures). This
# is the stale-turn-count detector bug from the comment above, not a content/consensus problem.
# Excluding this one repo (commit gate stays active for it; only the PUSH final-receipt check is
# skipped) rather than re-emptying ENABLED_REPO_ROOTS for every repo again. Revert by removing
# this block once review.js's correlation detector is independently confirmed fixed.
#
# pm-bridge push-gate excluded, 2026-08-26 (operator instruction: "нужно сделать так чтобы пм
# бридж имел право пушить"). Different reason from Fitness_App's, and a permanent one rather than
# a workaround: pm-bridge IS the review transport. Requiring a pm-bridge-produced final receipt
# before pm-bridge itself may be pushed is circular -- any defect in the transport blocks shipping
# the fix for that defect, and the more broken it is the more firmly it is locked. Gate A hit this
# directly: 22 review rounds were spent on the very machinery the gate depends on, and a session
# ended up asking the operator to choose between setting a kill switch, waiting indefinitely, or
# marking --final by hand on a review that had not concluded. A gate that can only be satisfied by
# faking its own evidence is not providing the guarantee it appears to.
#
# The COMMIT gate stays active for pm-bridge deliberately, so the repo keeps exercising its own
# review path on every commit -- only the push-side final-receipt requirement is skipped. This is
# not "pm-bridge is exempt from review"; it is "pm-bridge cannot be its own release authority".
# Reviews still run, receipts are still written, and their content still has to be read.
#
# NOTE: pm-bridge is deliberately NOT in this list. Its exemption is CONDITIONAL and implemented
# separately in main() -- GPT-PM's review of the unconditional first version returned a BLOCKER
# and was right. See the branch above the EXCLUDED_REPO_ROOTS check in main().
#
# Fitness_App push-gate exclusion REMOVED, 2026-08-30 (direct operator instruction: "надо включить
# обратно" -- re-enable it, in response to a report that surfaced this exclusion). The 2026-08-26
# rationale above (review.js correlation-detector bug withholding `final:true` despite a genuine
# GPT-PM APPROVE) is left in place as history, not deleted -- if that bug recurs, re-add
# r"D:\Repo\Fitness_App" here rather than rediscovering the same diagnosis from scratch. Until then,
# Fitness_App push follows the same final-receipt requirement as every other non-excluded repo
# under ENABLED_REPO_ROOTS.
