"""PreCompact hook -- reminds (never blocks) to bring core/DECISION_LOG.md
up to date right before the conversation gets summarized, whether triggered
manually (/compact) or by auto-compact. Operator GO, 2026-08-13.

Compaction is exactly the moment the "look back and understand why" problem
core/DECISION_LOG.md exists for gets hardest -- reasoning not yet on disk is
what the summary is about to compress away. There is intentionally no per-prompt decision-log reminder; this is the one low-frequency reminder point.

Never blocks: a hook that stalls compaction risks the exact context-overflow
situation auto-compact exists to prevent.

2026-09-30: this hook used to emit `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName: "PreCompact"` with
`additionalContext` -- confirmed against the primary Claude Code hooks doc
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md) that this was never a valid PreCompact output shape.
`additionalContext` is documented only for SessionStart/SubagentStart, UserPromptSubmit/
UserPromptExpansion, PreToolUse/PostToolUse/PostToolBatch, Stop/SubagentStop, and PostModelSwitch --
PreCompact's only documented output is the universal fields (`systemMessage` among them) plus
blocking via exit code 2 or a top-level `decision`. There is no valid JSON shape that injects
context into the model before compaction from this hook event -- fixed to emit `{"systemMessage":
...}` instead, which is shown to the operator (not guaranteed to reach the model as context) and
keeps this hook's "never blocks" contract. This is a narrowing of what the hook can do, not a
restoration of its original intent -- that intent is not achievable via PreCompact at all.
