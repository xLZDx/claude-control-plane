# functional-testing

## Apply when
Writing or reviewing behavior tests for a changed contract.

## Method
1. Name the contract: inputs -> observable outcome and state change.
2. Cover the matrix that applies: happy, alternate, boundary, invalid, permission, repeated/retry, concurrent, state after restart.
3. Every assertion must fail if the behavior breaks - mutate or revert the code (mentally or for real) to check.
4. Keep tests isolated: no order dependence, no shared mutable fixtures, deterministic clocks and ids.
5. Use the real boundary where a mock would hide the defect.

## Required output
Coverage map contract -> tests; ranked gaps; for each weak assertion the mutation that survives it.

## Do not
Count 'did not raise' as proof; assert implementation details instead of outcomes; accept coverage percentage as evidence.

Typical failure modes: `references/failure-modes.md` (read only when the work hits one of them).
